This policy works by inspecting `type` of `Service` resources and prevents the
creation of Services with type `LoadBalancer`.

Kubernetes network policies have no control over what is being exposed
via these type of Services. Moreover, on public clouds, the creation of
`LoadBalancer` Services leads to additional charges.

Because of that, it's usually a safer choice to have
tighter control over the creation of these type of Services.
